                <h2>Nicky Burns</h2>
                <p>Over a number of years, my hair became quite brittle and to my horror, a couple of years ago I
                    started to develop a bald spot at my hairline, above my forehead.<br>
                    It became my obsession to try to conceal what was happening, spending a lot of time consumed with
                    worry about windy days and whether others could see what I was so desperately trying to hide.<br>
                    One of my greatest challenges was going to the hairdresser and sitting in a busy salon under lights,
                    trying not to feel bad about what was before me in the mirror, eyes down, not wanting to see others
                    staring at me.<br>
                    A biopsy confirmed that I had a type of alopecia, and it was at that point I accepted that this was
                    not going to get better, and in fact, potentially it was going to get a lot worse.<br>
                    Out of desperation I googled mobile hairdressers and found In Style Mobile Hairdressing. I will
                    never forget the day that Jo arrived at my door for that first consultation. Jo walked in, hugged me
                    and said, “I’m here with you to help you on your journey, whatever that may be”.<br>
                    I felt a huge sense of relief, and from that moment on, I knew it was going to be ok. After some
                    months, I ordered my first Follea wig. I can honestly say that it has changed my life. I have
                    regained my confidence; I feel safe and secure and never worry about the weather!<br>
                    My hair will never grow back, but even if it did, I would not want to stop wearing my wig. I have
                    since bought a second one and I love them both.<br>
                    Jo is an amazing hairdresser. She has supported me so well over the past couple of years – I look
                    forward to her regular visits when she cuts what is left of my hair in the privacy of my own home,
                    and she also styles my wigs, and always does such a fantastic job.<br>
                    I cannot recommend Jo highly enough – she is a talented hairdresser, and a good friend nowadays.
                    Thank you Jo<br><br></p>

                <h2>Jo Jamieson</h2>
                <p>I found Jo at Instyle Mobile Hair whilst searching for a specialist that could help me source a
                    quality solution for my thinning hair. After a four year period of illness I had lost a significant
                    volume of hair and was struggling emotionally and was unable to style my own hair.<br> My
                    hairdresser at
                    the time told me bluntly that I was losing a huge amount of hair at the basin, which made me
                    embarrassed and fearful of going back to the hairdresser. My research finally lead me to the
                    Transitions website. I was so excited to find that Jo represented their products in New Zealand and
                    was based in Wellington! The fact that she would also travel to my home to treat and colour my own
                    hair and help me to source and fit a hair topper was reassuring.<br> Meeting Jo at that point in my
                    hair
                    journey was extremely important. She was very empathetic and helpful and I began to feel a bit
                    hopeful that I could find something which would help me to start looking (and hence feeling) like
                    myself once again. I now see Jo regularly at my home and she continues to be so helpful to me on my
                    hair journey. I have purchased two hair toppers from her thus far and we continue to experiment with
                    colours and styles. It is a process and I’m gaining more confidence as time goes by, helped
                    enormously by Jo’s support and professional knowledge. <br>Unfortunately, there are thousands of
                    people
                    dealing with hair loss and thinning hair and it can be a very tough time. I encourage anyone who is
                    in this type of situation, dealing with hair loss for any reason whatsoever, to seek out Jo’s expert
                    services and her access to these amazing products. Its a very positive step in the right direction
                    and Jo is just wonderful!<br><br></p>
